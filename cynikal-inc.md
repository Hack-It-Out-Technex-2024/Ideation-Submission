# hack it out, technex'24 IIT BHU Varanasi
## Team: `Cynikal Inc.`

## Track: `Secured Data Management System`

## Idea: `Comprehensive University Management System`

## Problem
Currently there exist multiple sources of information in IIT-BHU which are not interconnected, among which many a times a lot of information is paper based. This causes pointless duplication of work and a lot of time is wasted for the same.

## Solution
A comprehensive system which will have all the information about the students, faculty, courses, departments, hostels, mess, etc. This will help in reducing the time and effort required to get the information. This will also help in reducing the paper work and will help in making the system more efficient.

### Technical Features:
- **User Authentication**: The system will have a user authentication system which will help in keeping the data secure.
- **Previlege Based Access**: The system will have different levels of access for different users. For example, a student will not be able to access the data of the faculty and vice versa.
- **API Interface**: The system will have an API interface which will help in integrating the system with other systems.
