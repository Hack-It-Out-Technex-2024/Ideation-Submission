Vaishnavi Srmu: Creating a secure database management system involves various components such as database setup, user authentication, encryption, access control, and logging. Below, I'll provide a basic outline of how you could structure the code for such a project in Python using Flask framework and SQLite as the database:

Setup Database: Initialize SQLite database and create necessary tables.
Vaishnavi Srmu: User Authentication: Implement user registration, login, and logout functionality
Vaishnavi Srmu: Encryption: Ensure that sensitive data such as passwords are stored securely using hashing algorithms like SHA-256.

Access Control: Implement access control mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Logging: Implement logging to keep track of user activities and database transactions.

This is a basic example to get you started. Depending on your specific requirements and security considerations, you may need to add more features and enhance the code further. Additionally, always follow best practices for security, such as parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, using HTTPS for secure communication, and regularly updating dependencies.
